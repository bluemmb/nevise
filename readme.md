System for writting simple and pretty Documentations easily.

The system is built to be extended easily. It is not complicated and full-featured but it's base rules have made it easy to add extra extensions in it.

For now the only extension that is going to be supported is [moratab]. That is a tool for writting persian documentations with MarkDown language.
